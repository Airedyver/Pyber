Analysis

Observed Trend # 1 
Rides in rural areas are more expensive on average. Likely this is due to the number of miles that someone in a 
rural area is more likely to go. 

Observed Trend # 2
There are areas that have multiple rides in Urban and Suburban areas, but only a few drivers to take care of a 
large amount of rides. 

Observed Trend # 3 
There are a lot more drivers in rural areas than in Suburban or Urban areas. 

My suggestions for Pyber are as follows:
    Find a way to lower the rates in Rural areas. This should perhaps boost the amount of rides in the rural areas and 
    even out the amount of drivers as are in Urban and Suburban cities. 
    Create more incentives for drivers in URban and Suburban areas. Perhaps increasing the rates in order to pay 
    drivers in urban areas more.
